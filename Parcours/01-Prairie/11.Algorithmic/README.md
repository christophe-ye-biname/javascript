# Algorithmic

[pseudo_code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)

Computers are powerful machines able to calculate and produce all kinds of
output amazingly fast. However, they are not yet able to imagine and create by
themselves, that's were programmers intervene.

Programming is essentially writing *sets of instructions* that a computer can
understand to *create* a desired program, making the programmer a linguist of
sort. Yet, for the computer to understand you, you have to think like a
computer, you have to think [algorithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).

That makes it hard to translate human thought into computer logic. To help with
that you can write your algorithm in {pseudo_code}[pseudo code], an higher level
language closer to human speech.

It's really good practice to write your algorithm in pseudo code, before writing
them in actual code, as it allows for a language agnostic approach were what
matters is the logic not the syntax.

There is no set in stone way to write pseudo code, as long as, the algorithm is
clear. Still, for easier communication between everyone you could write yours
following this sets of [conventions](./conventions.md).
