# Functions

Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *30 min* +
Team challenge: *solo*

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* understand the concept of functions
* be able to write custom functions

## The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of [sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine),
complete the exercises down below after you've read the explanations.

A function is a *subroutine*, meaning a piece of instructions executed if called
within the main code. It can be used multiple times with different sets of value
each call. It usually needs to return a value with the *return* command.

````JS
// This function returns the square of a number
function square(_nbr_) {
	return _$nbr_  _$nbr_
}

output(square(5))// prints "25"
````

## Exercises

## Congrats

In the same vein as the loops, the functions will greatly help you improve your
code as it will enable you to reuse parts of it throughout your project.
